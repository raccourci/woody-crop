Optimized fork of the YoImages plugin to manage the image crop of the same ratio

## 👉🏻 Installation & Usage

First, install "Woody Crop" via the Composer package manager:
```bash
composer require woody-wordpress/woody-crop
```

## 🔥 Features of YoImages

YoImages Crop is a Wordpress plugin that provides image cropping functions.

📺 [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGkn7A8gA6M)

YoImages' cropping tools let you crop manually each cropping format that your theme defines: this feature gives you full control on how cropped versions of your images will look like.

You can choose to replace the source image for some specific formats.

From the image cropping interface you can change the image quality for each cropped format.

YoImages cropping is retina friendly: if you are using a retina plugin that uses the standard @2x as file naming convention when creating retina images from source (e.g. [WP Retina 2x](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/ "")) you can enable the retina friendly cropping option in YoImages' settings page and the manual crops will be created in retina format too.
